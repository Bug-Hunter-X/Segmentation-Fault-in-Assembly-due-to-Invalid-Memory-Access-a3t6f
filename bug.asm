mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 8]

This instruction attempts to access memory at an invalid address.  The problem lies in the calculation of the effective address. If `ebx + ecx*4 + 8` exceeds the bounds of the allocated memory, or if it points to a memory region the program is not allowed to access (e.g., kernel space), a segmentation fault or general protection fault will occur.
